# Space-Race-JS
I made space race in javascript!
This is the code to the classic arcade game called space race, you misson is to try to get to the other side as fast as possible by pressing the up and the down arrow.
I made this in a very short period of time.
Enjoy!
(I also made a 2 player version but tell me if you want that)
